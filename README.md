# student-directory_OOP

## This is an attempt at wrapping the code of my [student-directory](https://github.com/Clepsyd/student-directory) repository into classes.

How to use :

`ruby main.rb`

Through an interactive menu, the program allows you to:
- Add students and their data
- Remove students
- Display students currently in the list, with more or less details
- Save the current list in a CSV file
- Add to or replace the current list by loading from a CSV file

The file `fields.csv` can be edited to change what data is required for each student in
`@students_data_fields`
